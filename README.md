# Lung-Cancer-assessment
Our project leverages Machine Learning to predict lung cancer risk using key parameters like smoking status, age and etc, . We developed a Python-based predictive model, utilizing libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas for data processing and analysis. The model aims to provide early risk assessment,The code is available for further development.
